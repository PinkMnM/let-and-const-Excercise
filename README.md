Variables declared by let are only able to be accessed inside the block they are defined. Variables declared by var are able to be accessed throughout the functions in which they are defined and can also be reassigned and redeclared.
If you never want a variable to be redeclared or reassigned use const, also creates a block scope. Var lets a variable be redeclared and reassigned.
Let variables can be reassigned, const cannot be reassigned. 
Hoisting is a mechanic in Javascript where functions and variables which are declared using var are moved to the top of the scope before the code runs. Doesn't matter where the location is they will always be moved to the top.
